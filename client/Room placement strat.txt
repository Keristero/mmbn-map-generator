Room placement strat

Place first room in middle of gigantic grid
	Determine the child with the most child nodes
	Place that child - at a random position in a circle, the diameter is relative to the combined number of children of roomA and roomB
		If placement fails, try again x times
			If placement continues to fail, expand diameter of circle and try again y times (reset x)
	Find a path between the closest connections in both rooms
	(if possible reduce pathfinding cost of paths so that paths are reused)
	Repeat until all nodes are placed.
